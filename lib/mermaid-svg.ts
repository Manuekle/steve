 * and its own layout pass — no DOM, no measuring, so the same call works in a
 * client component and in a route handler. That is what lets the diagram in a
 * chat reply, the chart in a report card and the chart in the downloaded PDF
 * all come out of the same function instead of three drawing engines that
 * drift.
 *
 * What lives here is everything that has to happen to its output before it is
 * usable, and every caller needs all of it:
 *
 *   - the Google Fonts `@import` it hardcodes, removed
 *   - `xychart` series colours pointed back at the theme
 *   - one Mermaid construct it mis-parses, rewritten
 *   - optionally, the root `<svg>` made responsive
 *
 * Callers: `components/ai-elements/mermaid-plugin.ts` (```mermaid fences in a
 * reply), `app/_components/chat/artifacts/report-chart.tsx` (a `ChartSpec` in
 * a report) and `lib/report-pdf.ts` (the same chart, on paper).

 * own surface tokens. A diagram is a drawing, not a panel: it wants its own
 * flat, neutral palette rather than `--card` on `--card` with `--border`
 * between them, which is what an unstyled diagram inherited before and which
 * came out as a grey box on a grey box.
 *
 * All seven are passed on purpose. Anything left out is derived with
 * `color-mix()`, and Lightning CSS mangles `color-mix(… , transparent)` in
 * this project — it ships at full alpha — so a derived `--muted` would come
 * out as solid foreground.
