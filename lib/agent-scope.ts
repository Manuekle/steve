// The runtime half of "this agent may use these integrations".
//
// Eve's dynamic capabilities add and override authored tools; they cannot
// remove one. So scoping is enforced where the work actually happens — each
// gateable tool asks here before doing anything, and a refusal comes back as
// a sentence the model can relay ("no puedo cobrar desde acá") rather than as
// a stack trace or, worse, a charge nobody authorised.
//
// The rules, in the order they are applied:
//
//   1. No agent is assigned to this conversation's channel → allow. An
//      installation that never opened Mis Agentes keeps working exactly as it
//      did, which is the only acceptable default for a change that can
//      otherwise silently disable a working WhatsApp bot.
//   2. The assigned agent lists no capabilities → allow. The field used to be
//      free-form prose; an agent whose text nobody has re-picked must not read
//      as "allowed to do nothing".
//   3. Otherwise → only what the agent lists.
//
// Rules 1 and 2 are permissive on purpose. Scoping is a thing an operator
// turns on by making a choice, never something that happens to them.
