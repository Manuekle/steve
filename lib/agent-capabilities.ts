// What an agent is allowed to do, expressed as things a business owner
// recognises rather than as the names of files in agent/tools/.
//
// The unit here is a *capability*, not a tool. "Cobrar" is one line in the
// picker and two tools underneath; "Agenda" is one line and one tool. Nobody
// configuring a receptionist should have to know that sending a saved photo
// and sending a generated one are different modules — and tying the picker to
// module names would break every saved agent the day a tool is split in two.
//
// Three separate things are kept apart on purpose:
//
//   `tools`        which Eve tools the capability unlocks. The runtime guard
//                  in lib/agent-scope.ts reads this and nothing else.
//   `credentials`  what has to be configured in Settings for the capability
//                  to do anything. Purely for the UI, which greys out a
//                  capability whose integration is missing instead of letting
//                  someone pick a payment link with no Stripe key.
//   `connections`  the same question answered from the Connections page, for
//                  integrations reachable either way. Also UI-only.
//   `i18n`         label and description keys.
//
// A capability with no `credentials` works on a bare installation.
