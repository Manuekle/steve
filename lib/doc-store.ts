/**
 * PostgreSQL backing for the app's JSON stores.
 *
 * Documents, not schemas. Every one of these stores was a JSON file that its
 * module read whole, mutated in memory, and wrote back — business.json,
 * connections.json, credentials.json — and their call sites are written that
 * way throughout. Keeping one `jsonb` document per store preserves all of them
 * unchanged; normalising contacts, chats, automations, tokens and keys into
 * tables would be a rewrite of every module at once, and the shapes are still
 * moving.
 *
 * What it does buy, beyond surviving a read-only filesystem: `updateDocument`
 * takes a row lock, so two processes can no longer read the same document,
 * mutate their own copies, and have the second write erase the first. The file
 * mode's per-module `writeQueue` only ever serialised writes inside one
 * process — the Eve runtime and Next.js each had their own.
 *
 * Sized for the workload it actually has: one business, and stores of
 * kilobytes. If a single install ever grows past what is reasonable to read
 * and write whole, that is the signal to normalise, not this file's job to
 * pre-empt.
 *
 * Documents hold live secrets (OAuth tokens, API keys), exactly as the 0600
 * files they replace did. The database is the trust boundary: give this
 * connection string the access you would give that file.
