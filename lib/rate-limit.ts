 * One fixed-window limiter, shared by every route that needs one.

 * Scope, stated plainly: the counters live in this process's memory. On the
 * single-host deployment this repo ships — one Next.js service behind Caddy —
 * that is the whole story and the limit is real. Run two instances and each
 * gets its own budget, so the effective limit is `max * instances`; a deploy
 * resets every window. That is a weaker guarantee than a Redis or Postgres
 * counter, and it is written down here rather than implied.
 *
 * It is still worth having. The routes below are the ones where "unbounded"
 * costs money or hands out something: a password guess, an account, a reset
 * email, an LLM call. A limiter that a distributed attacker can multiply by
 * the instance count is a different thing from no limiter at all.
 *
 * If this app ever runs more than one instance, replace the map with a
 * `steve.rate_limits` table keyed the same way — the call sites do not change.

 * the only one a proxy we operate wrote. Counting from the right by the number
 * of proxies in front of this process is what makes the key unforgeable.
 *
