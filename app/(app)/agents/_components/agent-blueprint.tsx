// shape is fixed, and a canvas you could rearrange would be offering an edit
// that does not exist. So the nodes sit where they belong and clicking one
// opens its editor in the dock.

// The reading is honest, top to bottom: a message arrives on a channel, meets
// an agent with a name and a job, is answered under its rules and prompt on
// its model, using the capabilities and the business knowledge it was given.
//
// Monochrome, one line of text per node, nothing floating over it but the
// readiness line. Everything that was decoration is gone.
