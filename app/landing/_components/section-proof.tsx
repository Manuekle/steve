/**
 * Proof: who is running it, and what they say about it.
 *
 * This was two sections — a drifting testimonial wall, then a globe with the
 * clients on it — stacked one on the other, and they were the same claim made
 * twice. "People use this" and "here is what those people say" is one section
 * with two halves, not two sections; back to back they read as the page
 * running out of arguments and repeating itself with different furniture.
 *
 * Three things, then, each doing one job:
 *
 *   the globe   where they are — copy on the left, the sphere on the right
 *               running off the edge of the page. The crop is the composition;
 *               a sphere centred in a column with air all round it is an icon,
 *               and this section is not about the object.
 *   the quote   what one of them says. One at a time, crossfading, in the
 *               quarter under the copy a stat grid would hold.
 *   the rail    who they are — the same travelling row Fig 06 runs, at the
 *               foot of the section where a logo wall belongs.
 *
 * One quote rather than a wall of them, and that is the change that matters
 * most. A wall of nine is a wall nobody reads a single line of: the eye takes
 * it as texture, which is the honest outcome for a shape whose real message is
 * "there are a lot of these". One card at a reading size, held long enough to
 * finish, is a testimonial. The rest are still there — they come round.
 *
 * ── Where the content comes from ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `content/proof.json`, and nowhere else. Both lists ship empty, and while a
 * list is empty this section says so in plain words rather than filling the
 * space with something invented — a landing page that prints made-up praise or
 * made-up customers is a fabricated endorsement whichever way you look at it,
 * and the version of that mistake nobody catches is the one that was only ever
 * meant to be a placeholder.
 *
 * The file is JSON rather than a constant in this file so that adding a client
 * is not a code change, and not in the translation dictionaries either: a real
 * quote is published in the words it was said in, not in two languages.

                “ is the obvious version and it is heavier than the sentence it
                opens; this one is a shape you read past.

                Set here rather than through `Figure`, and much larger than
                `Figure`'s own size, because a quote mark is not a digit. A

                third of it and nothing else, so the two set at the same size
                are not the same size on the page — at `Figure`'s 3rem this
                came out around 20px and read as a speck. The stroke is one
                hairline at 10% white whatever the glyph is set at, so going
                bigger costs nothing in weight; it just makes the mark legible
                as glass.

                `-ml-1` is the optical alignment every hanging quote wants: the
                glyph's ink starts inset from its own box, so a mark set flush
                to the rail sits a few pixels right of the sentence under it. */}
