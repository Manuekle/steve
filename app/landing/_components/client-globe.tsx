/**
 * The globe. Cobe draws the sphere, the dot-mapped landmass and a pin per
 * client, and that is all this draws.
 *
 * Labels used to hang off every pin via CSS Anchor Positioning. The rail
 * under the section names the clients now, and two lists of the same names in
 * one section is one list too many — the pins say "here", the rail says who,
 * and neither has to shout over the other.
 *
 * ── Why labels were a performance problem ────────────────────────────
 *
 * Cobe v2 always calls $.s() inside every update(), unconditionally, which
 * does: `styleEl.textContent = ":root{...}"`. Any write to a <style> element's
 * textContent forces the browser to invalidate and recalculate styles for the
 * entire document — even when the content is just ":root{}" (empty custom
 * properties). At 60fps that is 60 forced style recalculations per second,
 * each one touching every styled element on the page.
 *
 * Two fixes working together:
 *
 *   1. No `id` on markers. Cobe uses marker ids to populate the CSS custom
 *      properties object (`a`). Without ids that object stays empty, so the
 *      string written to the style element is always ":root{}" — semantically
 *      a no-op, but still a write.
 *
 *   2. After `createGlobe()` returns, find the <style> element it injected
 *      into <head> and replace its `textContent` setter with a no-op. Cobe
 *      appends exactly one <style> element synchronously during construction,
 *      so the new element is always the last one in <head> when the call
 *      returns. Silencing it eliminates the forced recalc entirely without
 *      patching cobe itself.
 *
 * This also removes the label divs from the JSX — without them the custom
 * properties cobe would write serve no consumer. It also took with it the
 * labels' one real layout problem: clients cluster, six businesses in one
 * region put their pins within a few dozen pixels of each other, and six
 * labels hanging off that stack into an unreadable pile.
 *
 * CSS Anchor Positioning is also unsupported in Safari and Firefox, so the
 * labels were invisible to most visitors even before this change.
 *
 * ── Other per-frame costs addressed ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Cobe draws one frame per `update()` and runs no loop of its own, so the
 * `requestAnimationFrame` below is not the animation — it is the rendering.
 *
 * - `palette()` is cached and only passed to `update()` when the theme
 *   actually changes. Rotation-only frames pass just `{ phi, theta }`.
 * - On coarse-pointer devices the loop is throttled to ~30 fps.
 * - `width`/`height` are sent only on resize, never every frame.
 */
