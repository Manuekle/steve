/**
 * Public pages only.

 * Every column here used to be product routes — Panel, Bandeja, CRM, Leads,
 * Conexiones, Cuenta, twenty of them — and every one is behind the login. A
 * signed-out visitor, which is every visitor a footer is written for, clicked
 * any of them and landed on `/login?next=…`. That is not a sitemap, it is
 * twenty ways to be bounced, and it read as a template precisely because a
 * template is the only thing that would list a product's internal navigation
 * to strangers.
 *
 * What is left is what a stranger can actually open: the sections of the page
 * they are on, and the three pages that are not gated. The section list is
 * imported from the header rather than retyped, so the bar at the top and the
 * column at the bottom cannot disagree about what this page contains.

 * The three channels, arriving.
 *
 * The section's claim, drawn: senka at the centre of three rings and the
 * places people already write to you sitting on them. It is the one
 * illustration on the marketing surface and it is made entirely of pieces that
 * were already here — the mark, `BrandGlow`, and the plate every card in the
 * product uses — so it cannot drift away from the rest of the page.
 *
 * Rings, and hairline ones. A filled ripple would be the heaviest object in
 * the footer, competing with the sentence it sits beside; an outline is a
 * diagram. They are set at 42% radius rather than round, which is the squircle
 * the whole interface is drawn in.
 *
 * It bleeds off the panel's right edge on purpose. Centred in its own half it
 * is a picture in a box; running off it is a thing the panel is a window onto,
 * which is the same argument the screenshots make further up the page.
 *
 * `aria-hidden`, and below `lg` it is not rendered at all: at that width the
 * copy takes the whole panel and a 20rem illustration underneath it is a
 * second screenful of decoration on a phone.

 * operates it, and the sentence about conversations not leaving your machine —
 * was set at 12px in the bottom bar next to a theme toggle, which is where a
 * page puts text it does not expect anyone to read. It is the most specific
 * thing this product can say about itself and it is the reason a self-hosting
 * reader is on the page at all, so it moved up beside the wordmark, at a size
 * you can read, under a label that says what it is.
