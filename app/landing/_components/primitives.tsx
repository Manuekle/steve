 * always the point of masking them.
 *
 * Same construction as `.lp-veil` under the screenshots and for the same build
 * reason: the pipeline strips a hand-written `backdrop-filter`, so the blur is
 * carried on spans with utility classes.
 *

            it too, so the sliver that shows over the bezel is the brightest
            part of the wash: a smear along the top edge rather than a lamp.

            The tube is inset from the frame's sides by 14% each way, so it is
            shorter than what it lights. A fixture as wide as its subject is a
            backlit panel; one that is narrower throws a cone with edges, and
            the corners of the frame stay in the dark where they belong.

            Behind the frame, and by paint order rather than by `z-index`. Both
            fixtures are rendered *before* the frame and neither carries a
            z-index, so the frame's opaque `--card` covers the half of the cone
            that would otherwise fall across the interface — a screenshot with
            white poured down its first two hundred pixels is a screenshot you
            cannot read, and that is the failure mode of every landing page
            that discovered this effect. What survives is the tube, its bloom,
            and the light spilling past the window's edges, which is what you
            would actually see in a room.

            `-z-10` would have been the obvious way to say the same thing and
            it is wrong here: `.lp` paints its own `--background`, so a negative
            index does not put the beam behind the frame, it puts it behind the
            page.

            No pool under the foot, unlike the pricing card and the closing
            mark. A window whose bottom is being dissolved by the veil and lit
            from underneath at the same time is three treatments arguing over
            the same forty pixels — the wash erasing the edge, a glow insisting
            there is one, and the page under both. Light pools under objects
            that end; these end by going out of focus. One treatment at the
            foot, and it is the veil. */}
