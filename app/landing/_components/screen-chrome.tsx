/**
 * The app's shell, rebuilt around the app's own parts.
 *
 * These are not screenshots and they are not lookalikes: the screens in
 * `screen-*.tsx` render the components the product renders — `Card`,
 * `KpiCard`, `SlidingTabs`, `FlowCanvas`, `ToolResult`, `Pagination` — arranged
 * the way the matching page arranges them, over a fixed demo dataset. Where the
 * app uses an outline `Button`, so do they, so a change to the button system
 * shows up here on the next build instead of drifting quietly.
 *
 * The sidebar goes further and reads `NAV_GROUPS` straight from
 * `lib/nav-items`, the same list the real sidebar and the command palette
 * share. Adding a page to the app adds it to these screens.
 *
 * Every string here runs through `useT()`, the same dictionary the rest of
 * the app reads — the landing used to pin this subtree to Spanish, but the
 * mockups now follow whatever locale the visitor has chosen, same as
 * everything else on the page.
