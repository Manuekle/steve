 * `Plate` and `Row` is two card languages that look identical on the day they
 * are written and drift by the second edit — the page has one set of surfaces
 * and this is it.
 *
 * The vocabulary is deliberately small: a raised plate for an icon, a recessed
 * row for a record, a pill for a status, mono for a label, and a wash for the
 * edge a scene runs off. Anything a scene needs beyond these five is either a
 * one-off worth writing inline, or a sixth piece that belongs here.
 *
 * ── The motion contract ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything animates on `group-hover` and nothing animates on its own. The
 * resting frame is the *before* and hover plays the *after*, so a card is
 * never mid-thought when still. `prefers-reduced-motion` cuts every transition
 * in globals.css, which leaves that resting frame — already complete.
