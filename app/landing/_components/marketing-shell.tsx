/**
 * The frame every marketing page sits in: the dark wrapper, the header, the
 * footer, and the single IntersectionObserver that drives the reveals.
 *
 * It lives beside the landing's own components rather than in a folder of its
 * own because every marketing surface — the landing, pricing, the two legal
 * pages — is built from this same set. If the landing ever moves to `/` behind
 * a route group, the whole folder moves with it.
 *
 * `lp` no longer carries `dark`. It used to, which made the marketing surface
 * dark whatever the visitor had chosen inside the product — and made a theme
 * toggle on these pages a control that could not do its one job. The four
 * landing-only values that assumed a dark ground (the two hairline washes, the
 * bloom and the frame bevel) now have both halves in `globals.css`, so the
 * surface follows `<html>` like every other page.
 *
 * The marketing copy used to be pinned to Spanish with `I18nLocale`, on the
 * theory that it was hardcoded prose that couldn't follow the visitor's
 * locale. It no longer is: every string here runs through the dictionary, so
 * the pin is gone and this subtree reads `I18nContext` straight from
 * `I18nProvider`, the same one every other page uses.

/**
 * The opening block of a marketing page that is not the landing: an eyebrow,
 * a heading and a standfirst on the prose rail, over the same hairline the
 * feature sections use. Deliberately quieter than the landing's hero — these
 * are pages you arrive at knowing what you came for.
 *
 * Quieter, not unlit. Four pages come through here — pricing, the guide and
 * the two legal texts — and until the rig existed they all opened on a flat
 * rectangle of page colour with a heading on it. That is not restraint, it is
 * the landing's first screen and one of its four follow-ons belonging to
 * different products: the visitor who clicks "Precios" from a lit hero lands
 * somewhere that looks like it was built by someone else.
 *
 * So it takes the hero's backdrop at the hero's own intensity minus a step:
 * the hairline grid, and one beam entering from above and opening over the
 * heading. Left-biased for the same reason the hero's is — the copy is pinned
 * to the left rail, and a beam centred on the viewport lights the empty half.
 *
 * `top-0` rather than a negative offset, and `overflow-hidden` on the header:
 * the beam is cut by the header's own bottom border, and starting it flush
 * with the top means there is no *upper* edge to cut. The cone's mask fades in
 * over its first sixth, so it still arrives rather than switching on.
 *
 * Sideways it is anchored to the RAIL, not the viewport, which is why there is
 * a wrapper around it instead of a percentage `left`. The rail is centred and
 * capped at 1120px, so the heading's own position moves with the window while
 * a viewport percentage does not: a beam aimed at the copy on a 1440px screen
 * is aimed at empty page on a 1000px one. Inside a box that tracks the rail,
 * `left-0` means "the left edge of the column", which is where the heading
 * actually is at every width.
