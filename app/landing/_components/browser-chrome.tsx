/**
 * The browser toolbar every screen on this page now sits under.
 *
 * The frame around these mockups already read as a window, but as an
 * unlabelled one — a rounded rectangle with an app inside it, which is the
 * shape a design mockup has, not the shape a running product has. A toolbar
 * with an address in it says the thing in the picture is a page someone
 * loaded.
 *
 * The address is the argument. Every one of them is `localhost:3000`, because
 * that is where this software runs: the section three screens down claims the
 * whole app lives on your own machine, and this is that claim stated five
 * times in the one place a reader checks it without being asked to.
 *
 * Decoration throughout — `aria-hidden`, and inert anyway inside the frame's
 * `pointer-events-none`. A screen reader gets the frame's own label and skips
 * a toolbar that does nothing.
