 * It used to be a four-item marquee of monochrome glyphs at 15px, printed four
 * times so the track was wide enough to scroll. Two things were wrong with it:
 * a strip that moves on its own asks to be watched and then says nothing worth
 * watching, and "Chat web" alongside three product names is a feature standing
 * in a line of brands.
 *
 * Meta stands for the leads a Meta Ads form collects, which is what the line
 * underneath says instead of the old sentence about webhooks. A webhook is an
 * automation trigger; it was never somewhere a customer writes to you, which
 * is the claim this section makes.

            The section used to be three `lp-cap` cards — the app's KPI tile,

            tile earns its weight where it holds something: a number, a
            screenshot, a scene the cursor resolves. Here it holds a sentence,
            and a filled box around a sentence is packaging.

            What is left is the measurement itself: `.lp-line` puts a hairline
            over each column, the columns sit flush so those three hairlines
            read as one rule across the row, a vertical hairline separates
            them, and the container closes the block underneath. The columns
            are the same width they were, so the rhythm of the section does not
            move — only the box around it goes.

            The leftmost column carries no left inset: its heading has to start
            on the same rail as the section's own, or the whole row reads as

 * This section used to be four tiles with a static icon and a sentence. That
 * was fine while it was the page's only card grid; it stopped being fine when
 * the capability grid learned to answer the cursor, because a security section
 * that is quieter than the feature section reads as the part nobody worked on
 * — and it is the part a buyer's technical person actually stops at.
 *
 * The two entries that are new here were already true and simply never said:
 * every inbound webhook is verified by an HMAC over the raw body before it is
 * parsed, and every outbound call the agent makes is bounded by an allowlist
 * that also refuses loopback, private ranges and raw IPs. Both matter more to
 * the person reviewing this than three of the four that were here.
