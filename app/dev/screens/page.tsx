/**
 * Every landing mockup, on its own, at the real viewport width.
 *
 * The landing renders these five screens thousands of pixels down a page,
 * each one inside `ScreenFrame` — a bezel, a strip light, a progressive veil
 * over the bottom quarter, and five stacked `backdrop-filter` layers. That is
 * the right dressing for the marketing page and the wrong place to judge the
 * interface underneath it: half the screen is deliberately washed out, and the
 * frame's fixed 38rem crop hides whatever the layout does below it.
 *
 * This is the bare version. No frame, no light, no veil, no reveals — one
 * screen at a time, at the browser's own width, so the mockups can be checked
 * against the pages they claim to mirror (`/dashboard`, `/inbox`, `/agents`,
 * `/ads`, `/automations/[id]`, `/chat`) by opening the two side by side, and
 * so a phone or tablet width shows what it actually shows rather than what the
 * bezel is cropping.
 *
 * Dev only, like everything under /dev — the layout 404s this in production.
