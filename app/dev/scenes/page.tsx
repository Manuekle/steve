/**
 * Every card scene, side by side, at the widths they actually run at.
 *
 * The landing renders these twelve drawings 8000px down a page with a smooth
 * scroll driver, three reveal observers and a shuffling bento on top of them —
 * which is the right place for them and the wrong place to work on them. This
 * is the contact sheet: no shell, no reveals, no motion, every scene in the
 * same light at the same moment, so a change to the shared kit can be judged
 * on all twelve at once rather than one card at a time.
 *
 * Dev only, like everything under /dev — the layout 404s this in production.
