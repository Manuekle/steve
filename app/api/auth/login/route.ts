/**
 * Rate limited two ways: per address, and per address+email.
 *
 * scrypt at N=16384 costs ~100ms a try, which used to be the whole throttle
 * here — the argument being that a shared counter needs shared state this app
 * did not have. It has Postgres now, and more to the point 100ms is ~36,000
 * guesses an hour against a password floor of ten characters. That is a
 * throttle on one attacker's convenience, not on credential stuffing.
 *
 * The per-address budget is the wide one, so a shared office NAT is not locked
 * out by one person's typo. The per-email budget is the tight one, because
 * guessing *one* account's password is what an attacker is actually doing, and
 * it is keyed on the email rather than the address so rotating through proxies
 * does not reset it. See lib/rate-limit.ts for what the in-memory counter does
 * and does not promise.
