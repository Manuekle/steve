// public URL, so on a laptop running `next dev` a transcript never arrives at
// all, and even in production nothing exists to show *while* a call is
// happening. Polling the few unfinished calls closes both — the page already
// re-fetches this route every few seconds, so the live status comes along for
// free.
//
// POST is called from the browser the moment the in-browser Orb call
// connects, to tag that conversation "test" before the webhook can arrive —
// the same reason app/api/agents/[id]/voice/call/route.ts tags the outbound
// "Llamada de prueba" button's call. Without this, a call this app itself
// placed from inside the browser would default to "real" once the webhook
// shows up with no matching pending row.
