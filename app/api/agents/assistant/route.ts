// POST /api/agents/assistant
//
// The conversational half of the agent builder: the thing that asks the
// questions so the owner does not have to know what a system prompt is.
//
// Three properties separate it from /api/agents/optimize, which it does not
// replace:
//
//   1. It is a conversation, not a one-shot. The browser sends the turns so
//      far plus the draft as it currently stands, and each answer both fills
//      something in and asks the next thing it needs.
//   2. It knows the business. The identity the owner typed in, the generated
//      profile, and how many documents the knowledge base holds are all in
//      the system prompt — so the questions are about *their* business ("¿los
//      turnos se agendan en el Google Calendar que ya conectaste?") instead of
//      generic prompt-engineering trivia.
//   3. It never writes. The answer carries a patch the builder renders as a
//      proposal, and a person applies it. Same rule as the flow assistant.
//
// It writes nothing to the store — the builder's own autosave does that when
// the patch is applied.
