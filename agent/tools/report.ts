/**
 * A document, not a message.
 *
 * "Hacéme un informe de ventas del año" and "¿cómo venimos de ventas?" want
 * different things from the same numbers. The second wants two sentences and a
 * chart. The first wants something with a title, a period, headline figures,
 * sections, and a file at the end that can be forwarded to an accountant or
 * printed for a meeting — and a chat reply, however well written, is none of
 * those.
 *
 * The gap this closes is the last one: until now the agent could describe a
 * report but could not produce one. The console renders this spec as a
 * document card and offers it as a PDF, generated on demand from the same
 * spec by `app/api/reports/pdf/route.ts`.
 *
 * ## Why a spec and not Markdown
 *
 * The model could write the whole report as Markdown text and the chat would
 * render it. It would look like a chat message, because it would be one — no
 * cover, no KPI row, no page breaks, and nothing to hand to the PDF writer but
 * a wall of text to guess the structure of. Structure declared up front is
 * what makes the same content render correctly twice, on screen and on paper.
 *
 * Bodies are still Markdown, because prose is prose. It is the frame that is
 * typed.
 *
 * ## Console-only
 *
 * Same gate as `chart`, same reason: nothing on WhatsApp can render this.
