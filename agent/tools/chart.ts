/**
 * Draw the numbers instead of listing them.
 *
 * Every read tool in this agent — `pipeline`, `marketing`, `inbox`,
 * `operations` — returns rows. A model handed rows writes prose, and prose is
 * where a year of sales goes to die: eleven monthly figures in a paragraph is
 * a paragraph nobody finishes. The same eleven figures as a column chart with
 * one sentence under it is the answer.
 *
 * So this tool takes no query and reads nothing. It is a renderer: the model
 * has already fetched the data, and this is how it puts it on screen. The
 * console draws it from the validated call arguments
 * (`app/_components/chat/artifacts/chart-artifact.tsx`), which is why the
 * result here is one line — echoing the spec back would double its cost in
 * context for a payload the model just wrote.
 *
 * ## Not for diagrams
 *
 * A flow, a funnel, a process, an org map, a state machine — those are
 * Mermaid fences in the reply text. This is for quantities only. The two are
 * not interchangeable and the instructions say which is which.
 *
 * They do share a renderer, though. A chart drawn from this spec is Mermaid
 * `xychart-beta` (`lib/chart-mermaid.ts`) through the same `beautiful-mermaid`
 * call as a fence, so a chart and a diagram in the same reply are drawn by the
 * same engine at the same weight — and the PDF export can redraw the chart
 * from the same source.
 *
 * ## Console-only
 *
 * Gated like `pipeline` and `marketing` (lib/operator-console.ts), for a
 * different reason: WhatsApp and Instagram have no renderer, so a chart there
 * would be a tool call that produced nothing while the model believed it had
 * answered. Refusing tells it to write the numbers out instead.
