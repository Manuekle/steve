/**
 * The metallic look, per theme.
 *
 * `border-beam` ships four fixed palettes and no way to pass colors, so the
 * metal is mixed out of what it does expose: pick the palette whose hues sit
 * closest to the metal we want, crush `saturation` until the color reads as a
 * tint on gray rather than as a color, push `brightness` to get the sheen, and
 * nudge the whole thing with `--beam-hue-base` — a custom property the
 * package's own `filter` chains read, so setting it re-tints every layer
 * without clobbering their blur.
 *
 * Dark gets cool platinum: bright, blue-grey, high sheen against near-black.
 * Light gets warm graphite: a champagne cast, dimmer, so it stays legible as
 * an edge on a white card instead of washing out.

 * `BorderBeam` renders a wrapper `<div>` around the child, so anything
 * positional has to move off the child and onto the wrapper. Pass placement

 * `position: relative` from a stylesheet it injects after Tailwind's, and on
