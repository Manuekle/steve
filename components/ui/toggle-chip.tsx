// A chip that is either picked or not: the language row in the agent brief,
// the template row in the create dialog, the choice filter on a form step.
//
// All three were hand-written, and all three had drifted apart — one used
// `bg-muted` for the picked state and another `bg-accent`, one bordered at
// `foreground/30` and another at `/40`, and only two of the three set
// `aria-pressed`, so on the third a screen reader announced a plain button
// with no state at all. `aria-pressed` is not optional here and is set from
// `selected` rather than left to the caller.
//
// The surface comes from the system `Button`, which is what puts the chip back
// on the app's 11/9px radius — the copies were `rounded-full`, a pill the
// button scale does not define anywhere.
