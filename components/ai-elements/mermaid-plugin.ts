/**
 * The Mermaid renderer behind every ```mermaid fence in a chat reply.
 *
 * Streamdown asks a diagram plugin for an object with `render(id, source) ->
 * { svg }` and injects the string it gets back. The stock plugin
 * (`@streamdown/mermaid`) answers that by loading mermaid.js, which is a
 * ~500KB parser that builds the diagram by measuring real DOM nodes: it needs
 * a document, it cannot run on the server, and it is the single largest thing
 * the chat screen downloads.
 *
 * `beautiful-mermaid` does the same job with a text parser and its own layout
 * pass, so this returns an SVG string with no DOM involved at all. The
 * post-processing that makes its output usable — theme colours, the Google
 * Fonts import it hardcodes, the fixed pixel width — lives in
 * `lib/mermaid-svg.ts`, because the report card and the PDF export need
 * exactly the same treatment.
 *
 * What is left here is the one thing only this caller has: mermaid.js as a
 * fallback. `beautiful-mermaid` covers flowchart, sequence, class, ER, state
 * and xychart, and throws rather than drawing Mermaid's long tail (gantt,
 * mindmap, timeline, quadrant…) wrong. A fence in a reply can contain any of
 * those, so the cost of the big parser is paid by the diagram that needs it
 * and by nobody else.
